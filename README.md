# iGo
iGo is a program implemented in a bot in Telegram that offers the fastest path
from the user's location to a requested destination, all by driving in the city
of Barcelona.

## Introduction
The project is divided into two main parts:

* The `bot.py` module is used to interact with the users through Telegram by
responding to a defined group of functions, which are mainly focused on offering
a visual representation of the most optimal path from a place to another.

* The `igo.py` module consists of the functions that manage different graphs of
the city to compute the fastest path, taking into consideration up-to-date
information about how congested are the roads in Barcelona.

## Bot in Telegram
- The `TrafficAdvisor` bot, which can also be identified by the username `@DrivingToBot`,
  supports the following functionalities:

  - Being able to start an interaction with the bot by writing the command `/start`.

  - Receiving information about each possible command that works in the bot with
  `/help`.

  - Asking for information about the developers of the project by using the command
  `/author`.

  - Showing the current location of the user by using the function `/where`.

  - Obtaining the fastest path to the destination that has been chosen by the user,
  which is displayed in a map, when using `/go DESTINATION`.

  - Introducing a chosen current location, which can be different from the user's real
  current position, with `/pos`.

### Interact with the bot
Interacting with the bot is very easy, as it is possible to do it with any device that supports
Telegram. However, to be able to use it, the program `bot.py` must be executing.

## Computing the fastest path
- The `igo.py` module uses NetworkX, graphs from OSMnx, and information provided by the
Ajuntament de Barcelona to:

  - Download information from a CSV file by creating a list with the data.

  - Load a graph to the memory and be able to get it.

  - Know if a graph has been already created or not.

  - Print an image graph of the city of Barcelona, which can contain only the
  edges that correspond to the main roads or all the roads.

  - Compute the travel time in an edge knowing the `speed`, `length`, and the state of
the congestion, which is uploaded as the new version of the attribute `travel_time`.

  - Obtain the shortest path from two different locations.

  - Print a map that highlights a determined path.

### Usage of the module `igo`
In order to know how to use the functions defined in this module, it has been
included a group of examples, which are the following:

  - Printing a map that indicates the type of congestion in each highway:

`plot_congestions(highways, congestions, filename, graph_size)`

Parameters | Meaning
-----------|----------
highways | List of highways (defined `collections.namedtuple`) that include their ID, name, coordinates, and closest nodes
congestions | List of congestions (defined `collections.namedtuple`) that include their ID, time of the day and date, current state, and future state
filename | Wanted name for the map that is going to be saved as an image (`PNG`)
graph_size | Size of the map that is going to be printed

  - Computing the fastest path from one place to another:

`get_shortest_path_with_ispeeds(igraph, origin, destination)`

Parameters | Meaning
-----------|----------
igraph | Graph created by using the function `build_igraph` that contains the travel time of each edge considering the congestions
origin | Location in which the path starts, which can be the name or the coordinates
destination | Location in which the path ends, which can be the name or the coordinates

  ```{python}
  get_shortest_path_with_ispeeds(igraph, "Sagrada FamÃ­lia, Barcelona", "Campus Nord, Barcelona")
  get_shortest_path_with_ispeeds(igraph, [41.4036299, 2.1743558], [41.388575, 2.112256])
  ```
  - Plotting the graph in the map of the city:

  `plot_path(igraph, ipath, graph_size, file_name)`

  Parameters | Meaning
  -----------|----------
  igraph | Graph that contains the travel time of each edge considering the congestions
  ipath | Path created with the function `get_shortest_path_with_ispeeds`
  graph_size | Size of the map that is going to be printed
  filename | Wanted name for the map that is going to be saved as an image (PNG)


## Requirements
To be able to execute the different modules, it is necessary to install a set of packages that are
in the `requirements.txt`, which includes the versions used in the project. This can be done by
using the command:

> pip install -r requirements.txt
